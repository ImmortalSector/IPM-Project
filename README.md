# IPM-Project
This project corresponds to a web application that was built with the help of an open-source model-view-viewmodel front end Javascript framework, Vue.js.

## In order to run the application, the user most follow the following steps:

0. If you don't have it, get node.js installed first. You can get it on the following site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

      > Make shure you have node availlable globally by running the command:
      > 
           > node -v
      > 
      > It should then show you the version of your node. If it doesn't node is not properly installed. Try and contact our team.


1. After installig node.js you are gonna need vue. Run the following command: 
           
           > npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global

      
      
2. After installing vue, all you need is to download the project from git. Navigate to the wefit folder on two different console instances, you'll need them to run the backend and the frontend at the same time.

3. Run the following commands, one on each console (order shouldnt matter):

          > npm run serve
           
          > npm run db
      
      

4. On the console instance where you ran "npm run serve" wait for two links to be displayed. After that either click the any of the links or type them in your browser. 

5. You are now running wefit
